Tetris Game

We built a simple game with login and registration including react hooks styled-components and jsonwebtoken.The goal consists the user be able to login 
and logout safely and have their highscore on the table according to their performance in the game tetris.
Players can complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. 
The game ends when the uncleared lines reach the top of the playing field. 
The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score will be.
